                Hi, I'm Patrick Hirsh, a
                <a href="https://github.com/patrickhirsh">software engineer</a>
                based in Salt Lake City with a passion for graphics, game engines, and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Fluxtrance">building virtual worlds.</a><br><br>

                <!-- If you're seeing this, then we probably met at GDC 2019! You're one of the (lucky?) 
                few to see my site in it's current state - I hope you find my lack of CSS (or design) 
                endearing. It wont be like this for long!<br><br>

                I'm finishing up my undergrad at the University of Utah in Computer Science with an 
                emphasis in Entertainment Arts & Engineering. I spend the bulk of my free time 
                pursuing personal projects related to graphics and 
                microcontrollers like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. When I'm not developing, 
                I love to create things and share them with others! I have a YouTube channel called 
                "Fluxtrance" which I've grown over the years to ~180k subscribers and 34.8 million 
                video views. When I'm not working, I like to hike, ski, and play pinball! Feel free 
                to
