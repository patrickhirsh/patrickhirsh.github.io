                    Hello! I'm Patrick Hirsh, a software engineer and game developer based 
                    in Salt Lake City, Utah.<br><br>
                    
                    If you're seeing this, then we probably met at GDC 2019! You're one of the (lucky?) 
                    few to see my site in it's current state. I hope you find my lack of CSS (or design) 
                    endearing. It wont be like this for long!<br><br>

                    I'm finishing up my undergrad at the University of Utah in Computer Science with an 
                    emphasis in Entertainment Arts & Engineering. You can find my dev experience in my 
                    resume below - but when I'm not developing, I love to create things and share them 
                    with others! I have a YouTube channel called "Fluxtrance" which I've grown over the 
                    years to ~180k subscribers and 34.8 million video views. When I'm not working, I like 
                    to hike, ski, and play pinball!<br><br>

                    Let's chat! You can find me here:
