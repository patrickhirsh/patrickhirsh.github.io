                    Hello! I'm Patrick Hirsh, a software engineer and game developer based 
                    in Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm finishing up my undergrad at the University 
                    of Utah in Computer Science with an emphasis in Entertainment Arts 
                    & Engineering in the Fall of 2019!<br><br>

                    While you may get an idea of the areas I've explored in the realm of 
                    Computer Science from the projects on my resume, I'm always looking 
                    for opportunities to learn from others and gain experience in new technology! <br><br>

                    When I'm not developing, I love to create things and share them with others. 
                    I have a YouTube channel called "Fluxtrance" which I've grown over the years 
                    to ~180k subscribers and 34.8 million video views. In my free time, I like to 
                    hike, ski, and play pinball!<br><br>

                    If you're seeing this, then we probably met at GDC 2019! You're one of the (lucky?) 
                    few to see my site in this state while I work on building it. Please don't hesitate 
                    to reach out at any of the links below if you'd like to get in contact!<br><br>
